# Changelog

## [3.5.6] - 2026-07-26

### Added & Changed
- **Dynamic AES-256-GCM Key Scraping for AllManga**: Updated the AllManga scraper (`backend/src/scraper/allmanga.ts`) and `yorumi-cli` (`v2.1.8`) to dynamically scrape encryption keys (`epoch`, `partB`, and SvelteKit JS chunks) from `mkissa.to` at runtime to derive the AES-256-GCM key (`aaKey`), preventing static key expiration.
- **ani-cli Flow Alignment**: Synchronized time-bucketed `aaReq` signature generation (using seconds-based timestamping and `epoch:queryHash:ts` SHA-256 nonces), switched API requests to `mkissa.net/api`, and updated headers to match `mkissa.to` Origin and Referer requirements.
- **Enhanced Payload Decryption**: Added robust fallback handling in `allmanga.ts` (`decryptTobeparsed` and `parseEpisodeSources`) to support both plaintext source payloads and AES-256-GCM encrypted `tobeparsed` responses.
- **Primary Player Server Migration**: Restored `AllManga` as the default visible streaming provider globally across the player and backend `auto` stream priority.
- **Anime Hover Tooltips & Metadata**: Improved home section anime cards to display comprehensive AniList metadata (airing status, release year, studio, format, episode count, and genre chips) without score percentages.
- **Title Routing & Search Scoring**: Enhanced AllManga title matching so base TV anime series outrank movies, OVAs, or specials.
- **Video Player Toggle Sliders**: Fixed broken toggle switch styling in video player settings (`Dub`, `Auto next`, `Auto Skip`) by replacing invalid `left-4.5` classes with `translate-x-4` so the knob smoothly slides to the right when toggled ON.
- **Sidebar & README Logo Polish**: Fixed broken sidebar logo image upon bundling in Electron/production builds by importing `yorumi-icon.png` from `src/assets/yorumi-icon.png` (matching the logo used in the README) so Vite bundles and resolves the asset cleanly across web and desktop builds. Reduced the README logo image width to 100px for a more balanced layout.
- **Season 2 & Sequel Anime Streaming Resolution**: Resolved an issue where season 2 and sequel anime episodes in the "Latest Episodes" section failed to stream. Fixed `allmanga.ts` (`getLinksForShowId`) to prioritize the explicit mkissa season `showId` over ambiguous AniList title resolution, and bumped the cache version to `v8` in `scraper.service.ts` to clear stale empty stream caches.

### Removed
- **Defunct Streaming Providers**: Removed offline or deprecated providers (`Animegg`, `Animenosub`, `Reanime`, `AniNeko`) from the player server picker and backend source defaults so users only encounter active, high-speed servers.
- **Embed Navigation Buttons**: Removed floating next/previous episode overlay buttons from embedded iframe players.

# Yorumi v2.0-rc1: Mobile Revolution & Enhanced Engine

### 📱 Mobile Experience Overhaul
The UI has been completely re-engineered for mobile devices, offering a seamless native-like experience.
- **Spotlight Hero 2.0:** Now fully responsive with a dedicated **Cover Art** display on mobile, ensuring main characters are visible even when background banners are cropped. Includes optimized typography and spacing.
- **Adaptive Layouts:** Action buttons (*Read Now, Add to List*) now align **side-by-side** on mobile for easier thumb access.
- **Smart Navigation:** New mobile-optimized navbar with a dedicated search overlay and collapsible menus.
- **Readability Improvements:** Adjusted font sizes and container widths across Anime & Manga details pages for better readability on small screens.

### 📚 Manga Reader 2.0 (Mobile)
A totally revamped reading experience for mobile users.
- **Focus Mode:** Sidebars (Chapter List & Details) now auto-collapse on mobile to maximize reading space.
- **Accessible Controls:** Added a floating toggle button for easy access to chapters without leaving the immersive view.
- **Touch-Optimized:** Improved touch targets for navigation and zooming.

### ⚡ Enhanced Content Engine
We've significantly improved the matching algorithm to ensure you always get the right content.
- **Prioritized Content Matching:** Fixed issues with series like *"Solo Leveling"* by prioritizing entries with higher chapter counts (e.g., Manhwa vs Novel).
- **Global Synonym Search:** The search engine now intelligently matches alternative titles (e.g., searching *"Teenage Mercenary"* correctly identifies and loads *"Mercenary Enrollment"*).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed layout shift on mobile search close.
- Resolved vertical stacking issues on Details page buttons.
- Optimized image loading for banner backgrounds.
